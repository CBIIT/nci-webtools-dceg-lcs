        <div class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 1:</strong><em>Does the patient live in the Northern, Central, or Southern United States?</em></div>
        <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
          radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
          in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.

      <hr>
      <div class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 2:</strong><em>What is the patient's gender?</em></div>
      <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
        factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
        women.
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p class="about-question-title"><a name="q3"></a><strong>Question 3:</strong><em>What is the patient's race?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
        were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
        often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
        damaged by the sun.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p class="about-question-title"><a name="q4"></a><strong>Question 4:</strong><em>What is the patient's age?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
        over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.

      <hr>
      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 5:</strong><br><em>Has the patient ever had a blistering sunburn?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased risk
        of melanoma. Doctors advise protection from the sun to reduce the risk of melanoma.

      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 5 for females:</strong><br><strong>Question 6 for males:</strong><br><em>Is the patient's complexion light, medium, or dark?</em><br></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
        easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
        people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the
        sun.

      <hr>
      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 6 (for females only):</strong><em>
          After repeated and prolonged exposure to sunlight, at the age the patient is now,
          how tan would the patient's skin become?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
        not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
        to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
        however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
        that they have.

      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 7 (for males only):</strong><em>How many moles larger than 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
        larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
        and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier than
        on chronically exposed areas.

      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 7 for females:</strong><strong>Question 8 for males:</strong><em>How many moles less than or equal to 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Having many moles, particularly larger moles, increases the risk of developing melanoma.
        The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
        than on chronically exposed areas. Characteristics of the back are highly correlated
        with total body characteristics.

      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 8 for females:</strong><strong>Question 9 for males:</strong><em>How extensive is the freckling on the patient's back and shoulders?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that freckles easily.
        The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
        than on chronically exposed areas.

      <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 10 (for males only):</strong><em>Does the patient have severe solar damage on the shoulders?</em></p>
      <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that
        can lead to melanoma.

      <hr><a name="results"></a><strong>Explaining the Results</strong>
      <p>
        The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
        melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
        information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
        melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
        melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
        estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
        melanoma cancer.

      <hr><a name="model"></a><strong>About the Model</strong>
      <p>
        The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
        patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
        Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
        in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
        model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
        been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
        additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
        available. The system is currently on statistical model version 1 and software version
