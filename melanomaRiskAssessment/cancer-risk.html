        No one knows the exact causes of melanoma. Doctors can seldom explain why one person
        gets melanoma and another does not. However, research has shown that people with
        certain<a href="javascript:popUp('def-risk factors.html')" class="define">risk factors</a>are more likely than others to develop melanoma. Anything that increases the chance
        of developing a disease is called a risk factor.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Personal history of melanoma or skin cancer:</strong> People who have been
        treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second, separate melanoma. Some people
        develop more than two melanomas. People who have had one or more of the common skin
        cancers (<a href="javascript:popUp('def-basal cell carcinoma.html')" class="define"></a>basal
        cell carcinoma
         or<a href="javascript:popUp('def-squamous cell carcinoma.html')" class="define"></a>squamous cell carcinoma
        ) are also at increased risk of melanoma. These
        individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs and this risk assessment
        tool is not appropriate for them.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Family history of melanoma:</strong> Melanoma sometimes runs in families.
        Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
        of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only
        about 1% of individuals with melanoma have more than one family member with
        melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
        with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Many ordinary moles:</strong> Having many moles, particularly larger moles,
        increases the risk of developing melanoma.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dysplastic nevi:</strong> Dysplastic nevi are larger, flat, irregular moles
        that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
        relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
        of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
        risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi
        and melanoma.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Fair skin or freckles:</strong> Melanoma occurs more frequently in people
        who have fair skin that burns or freckles than in people with dark skin, probably
        because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
        had enough sun to damage their skin.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Severe, blistering sunburns:</strong> People who have had at least one severe,
        blistering sunburn are at increased risk of melanoma. Doctors particularly advise
        that parents protect children's skin from the sun. Such protection may reduce the
        risk of melanoma later in life.
      </p>
      <p><strong><a href="javascript:popUp('def-Ultraviolet (UV) radiation.html')" class="define">Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</a>:</strong> Melanoma is more common in people who
        live in areas that get large amounts of UV radiation from the sun. In the United
        States, for example, melanoma is more common in California than in Minnesota, where the
        sun is not as strong. UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin
        and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Artificial sources of UV radiation, such
        as sunlamps and tanning booths, can also cause skin damage and increase the risk
        of melanoma. Doctors encourage people to limit their exposure to natural UV radiation
        and to avoid artificial sources.:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Weakened</strong><a href="javascript:popUp('def-immune system.html')" class="define">immune system:</a>People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers or other
        immune disorders, or by drugs given after organ<a href="javascript:popUp('def-transplantation.html')" class="define">transplantation</a>, are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Although these conditions
        are not common, it would be advisable for such individuals to be in
        screening and surveillance programs.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
          People who are concerned about developing melanoma should talk with their doctor
          about the disease, the symptoms to watch for, and an appropriate schedule for checkups.
          The doctor's advice will be based on the individual's personal and family history,
          medical history, and other risk factors.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Doctors recommend that everyone take steps to help prevent and reduce the risk of
        melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV radiation:
        <ul class="red-arrow">
          <li>
            Avoid exposure to the midday sun (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) whenever possible. When
            your shadow is shorter than you are, remember to protect yourself from the sun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid exposure to artificial sources of UV radiation, such as sunlamps and tanning
            booths.
          </li>
          <li>If you must be outside, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a hat with a wide brim.</li>
          <li>
            Protect yourself from UV radiation that can penetrate light clothing, windshields,
            and windows.
          </li>
          <li>Protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice.</li>
          <li>Protect yourself when you are at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.</li>
          <li>Help protect your skin by using a lotion, cream, or gel that contains<a href="javascript:popUp('def-sunscreen.html')" class="define"></a><em>sunscreen</em>. Use sunscreens
                that reflect, absorb, and/or scatter both types of ultraviolet radiation. These
                sunscreen products will be labeled with "broad-spectrum coverage." Use
                a sunscreen with a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for more protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wear sunglasses that have UV-absorbing lenses. The label should specify that the
            lenses block at least 99 percent of<a href="javascript:popUp('def-UVA.html')" class="define">UVA</a> and<a href="javascript:popUp('def-UVB radiation.html')" class="define">UVB</a> radiation. Sunglasses can protect both the eyes and the skin around the eyes.
          </li>
