              An interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
              the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, San Francisco,
              to estimate a person's &nbsp;<a data-term="ar" class="termToDefine">absolute risk</a> of developing invasive melanoma. The tool helps clinicians identify
              individuals at increased risk of melanoma in order to plan
              appropriate screening interventions with them.

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
              radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
              in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
              factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
              women.

            <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
              were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
              often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
              damaged by the sun.

            <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
              over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.

              of melanoma. Doctors advise protection from the sun to reduce the risk of melanoma.

            <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
              easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
              people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the

                After repeated and prolonged exposure to sunlight, at the age the patient is now,
                how tan would the patient's skin become?</em></p>
            <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
              not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
              to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
              however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
              that they have.

            <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
              larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back

              on chronically exposed areas.

            <p>
              The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
              melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
              information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
              melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
              melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
              estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
              melanoma cancer.

            <p>
              The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
              patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
              Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
              in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
              model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
              been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
              additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
              available. The system is currently on statistical model version 1 and software version

          <ul class="red-arrow">
            <li>
              The melanoma risk calculator was designed for use by health professionals during
              a routine physical examination that includes recording of information about the
              patient's personal and family medical history and an examination of the skin on
              the patient's back and shoulders. If you are not a health professional, you are
              strongly encouraged to discuss the results obtained with this tool and your personal
              risk of melanoma with your doctor.
            </li>
            <li>
              The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
              available.
            </li>
            <li>
              This tool should not be used to estimate melanoma risk for people who have already
              had a diagnosis of melanoma, melanoma-in-situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, or a family
              history of melanoma. These individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The melanoma risk calculator was developed using data from a large case-control
              study in the United States. Risks are estimated for non-Hispanic whites only; data
              for other races/ethnicities are too limited to accurately estimate risk.

          <p>
            No one knows the exact causes of melanoma. Doctors can seldom explain why one person
            gets melanoma and another does not. However, research has shown that people with
            certain
            &nbsp;<a data-term="rf" class="termToDefine">risk factors</a> are more likely than others to develop melanoma. Anything that increases the chance
            of developing a disease is called a risk factor.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Personal history of melanoma or skin cancer</dt>
            <dd>
               People who have been
              treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second, separate melanoma. Some people
              develop more than two melanomas. People who have had one or more of the common skin
              cancers (<a data-term="bcc" class="termToDefine"></a>basal
              cell carcinoma
               or<a data-term="scc" class="termToDefine"></a>squamous cell carcinoma
              ) are also at increased risk of melanoma. These
              individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs and this risk assessment
              tool is not appropriate for them.
            </dd>
            <dt>Family history of melanoma:</dt>
            <dd>
              Melanoma sometimes runs in families.
              Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
              of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only
              about 1% of individuals with melanoma have more than one family member with
              melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
              with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.
            </dd>
            <dt>Many ordinary moles:</dt>
            <dd>
              Having many moles, particularly larger moles,
              increases the risk of developing melanoma.
            </dd>
            <dt>Dysplastic nevi:</dt>
            <dd>
              Dysplastic nevi are larger, flat, irregular moles
              that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
              relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
              of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
              risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi
              and melanoma.
            </dd>
            <dt>Fair skin or freckles:</dt>
            <dd>
              Melanoma occurs more frequently in people
              who have fair skin that burns or freckles than in people with dark skin, probably
              because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
              had enough sun to damage their skin.
            </dd>
            <dt>Severe, blistering sunburns:</dt>
            <dd>
              People who have had at least one severe,
              blistering sunburn are at increased risk of melanoma. Doctors particularly advise
              that parents protect children's skin from the sun. Such protection may reduce the
              risk of melanoma later in life.
            </dd>
            <dt><a data-term="uv" class="termToDefine">Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</a>:</dt>
            <dd>
              Melanoma is more common in people who
              live in areas that get large amounts of UV radiation from the sun. In the United
              States, for example, melanoma is more common in California than in Minnesota, where the
              sun is not as strong. UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin
              and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Artificial sources of UV radiation, such
              as sunlamps and tanning booths, can also cause skin damage and increase the risk
              of melanoma. Doctors encourage people to limit their exposure to natural UV radiation
              and to avoid artificial sources.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              Weakened
              &nbsp;<a data-term="is" class="termToDefine">immune system:</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers or other
              immune disorders, or by drugs given after organ
              &nbsp;<a data-term="transplant" class="termToDefine">transplantation</a>, are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Although these conditions
              are not common, it would be advisable for such individuals to be in
              screening and surveillance programs.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p><strong>
              People who are concerned about developing melanoma should talk with their doctor
              about the disease, the symptoms to watch for, and an appropriate schedule for checkups.
              The doctor's advice will be based on the individual's personal and family history,
              medical history, and other risk factors.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Doctors recommend that everyone take steps to help prevent and reduce the risk of
            melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV radiation:
            <ul class="red-arrow">
              <li>
                Avoid exposure to the midday sun (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) whenever possible. When
                your shadow is shorter than you are, remember to protect yourself from the sun.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid exposure to artificial sources of UV radiation, such as sunlamps and tanning
                booths.
              </li>
              <li>If you must be outside, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a hat with a wide brim.</li>
              <li>
                Protect yourself from UV radiation that can penetrate light clothing, windshields,
                and windows.
              </li>
              <li>Protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice.</li>
              <li>Protect yourself when you are at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.</li>
              <li>Help protect your skin by using a lotion, cream, or gel that contains<a data-term="ss" class="termToDefine"></a><em>sunscreen</em>. Use sunscreens
                    that reflect, absorb, and/or scatter both types of ultraviolet radiation. These
                    sunscreen products will be labeled with "broad-spectrum coverage." Use
                    a sunscreen with a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for more protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wear sunglasses that have UV-absorbing lenses. The label should specify that the
                lenses block at least 99 percent of
                &nbsp;<a data-term="uva" class="termToDefine">UVA</a>&nbsp;
                and
                &nbsp;<a data-term="uvb" class="termToDefine">UVB</a> radiation. Sunglasses can protect both the eyes and the skin around the eyes.
