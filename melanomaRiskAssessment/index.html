          <div id="questions-exp">
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 1: In what state does the patient reside?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
              radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
              in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 2: What is the patient's gender?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
              factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
              women.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 3: What is the patient's race?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
              were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
              often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
              damaged by the sun.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 4: What is the patient's age?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
              over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 5: Has the patient ever had a blistering sunburn?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased risk
              of melanoma. Doctors advise protection from the sun to reduce the risk of melanoma.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 5 for females:<br>Question 6 for males: Is the patient's complexion light, medium, or dark?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
              easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
              people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the
              sun.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">
              Question 6 (for females only): After repeated and prolonged exposure to sunlight, at the age the patient is now,
              how tan would the patient's skin become?
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
              not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
              to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
              however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
              that they have.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 7 (for males only): How many moles larger than 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
              larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
              and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier than
              on chronically exposed areas.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 7 for females:<br>Question 8 for males: How many moles less than or equal to 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Having many moles, particularly larger moles, increases the risk of developing melanoma.
              The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
              than on chronically exposed areas. Characteristics of the back are highly correlated
              with total body characteristics.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 8 for females:<br>Question 9 for males: How extensive is the freckling on the patient's back and shoulders?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that freckles easily.
              The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
              than on chronically exposed areas.
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-title">Question 10 (for males only): Does the patient have severe solar damage on the shoulders?</div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that
              can lead to melanoma.

              The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
              melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
              information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
              melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
              melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
              estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
              melanoma cancer.

            <p>
              The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
              patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
              Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
              in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
              model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
              been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
              additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.

            The Melanoma Risk Assessment is an interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
            the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, San Francisco,
            to estimate a person's &nbsp;<i data-term="ar" class="termToDefine">absolute risk</i> of developing invasive melanoma. The tool helps clinicians identify
            individuals at increased risk of melanoma in order to plan
            appropriate screening interventions with them.

              <p>
                The melanoma risk calculator was developed using data from a large case-control
                study in the United States. Risks are estimated for non-Hispanic whites only; data
                for other races/ethnicities are too limited to accurately estimate risk.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The melanoma risk calculator was designed for use by health professionals during
                  a routine physical examination that includes recording of information about the
                  patient's personal and family medical history and an examination of the skin on
                  the patient's back and shoulders. If you are not a health professional, you are
                  strongly encouraged to discuss the results obtained with this tool and your personal
                  risk of melanoma with your doctor.

                <li>
                  This tool should not be used to estimate melanoma risk for people who have already
                  had a diagnosis of melanoma, melanoma-in-situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, or a family
                  history of melanoma. These individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs.

              No one knows the exact causes of melanoma. Doctors can seldom explain why one person
              gets melanoma and another does not. However, research has shown that people with
              certain
              &nbsp;<i data-term="rf" class="termToDefine">risk factors</i> are more likely than others to develop melanoma. Anything that increases the chance
              of developing a disease is called a risk factor.
            </p>
            <dd><strong>Personal history of melanoma or skin cancer</strong>
              <p>
                 People who have been
                treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second, separate melanoma. Some people
                develop more than two melanomas. People who have had one or more of the common skin
                cancers (<i data-term="bcc" class="termToDefine"></i>basal
                cell carcinoma
                 or<i data-term="scc" class="termToDefine"></i>squamous cell carcinoma
                ) are also at increased risk of melanoma. These
                individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs and this risk assessment
                tool is not appropriate for them.

                Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
                of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only
                about 1% of individuals with melanoma have more than one family member with
                melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
                with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.

              <p>
                Having many moles, particularly larger moles,
                increases the risk of developing melanoma.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dd><strong>Dysplastic nevi</strong>
              <p>
                Dysplastic nevi are larger, flat, irregular moles
                that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
                relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
                of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
                risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi and melanoma.

              <p>
                Melanoma occurs more frequently in people
                who have fair skin that burns or freckles than in people with dark skin, probably
                because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
                had enough sun to damage their skin.

              <p>
                People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased
                risk of melanoma. Doctors particularly advise that parents protect children's
                skin from the sun. Such protection may reduce the risk of melanoma
                later in life.

              <p>
                Melanoma is more common in people who
                live in areas that get large amounts of UV radiation from the sun. In the United
                States, for example, melanoma is more common in California than in Minnesota, where the
                sun is not as strong. UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin
                and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Artificial sources of UV radiation, such
                as sunlamps and tanning booths, can also cause skin damage and increase the risk
                of melanoma. Doctors encourage people to limit their exposure to natural UV radiation
                and to avoid artificial sources.

              <p>
                People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers or other
                immune disorders, or by drugs given after organ
                &nbsp;<i data-term="transplant" class="termToDefine">transplantation</i>, are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Although these conditions
                are not common, it would be advisable for such individuals to be in
                screening and surveillance programs.

            People who are concerned about developing melanoma should talk with their doctor
            about the disease, the symptoms to watch for, and an appropriate schedule for checkups.
            The doctor's advice will be based on the individual's personal and family history,
            medical history, and other risk factors.</strong>
          <p>
            Doctors recommend that everyone take steps to help prevent and reduce the risk of
            melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV radiation:
          </p>
          <ul class="red-arrow two-col">
            <li>
              Avoid exposure to the midday sun (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) whenever possible. When
              your shadow is shorter than you are, remember to protect yourself from the sun.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid exposure to artificial sources of UV radiation, such as sunlamps and tanning
              booths.
            </li>
            <li>If you must be outside, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a hat with a wide brim.</li>
            <li>
              Protect yourself from UV radiation that can penetrate light clothing, windshields,
              and windows.
            </li>
            <li>Protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice.</li>
            <li>Protect yourself when you are at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.</li>
            <li>Help protect your skin by using a lotion, cream, or gel that contains&nbsp;<i data-term="ss" class="termToDefine">sunscreen</i>. Use sunscreens
                  that reflect, absorb, and/or scatter both types of ultraviolet radiation. These
                  sunscreen products will be labeled with "broad-spectrum coverage." Use
                  a sunscreen with a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for more protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wear sunglasses that have UV-absorbing lenses. The label should specify that the
              lenses block at least 99 percent of
              &nbsp;<i data-term="uva" class="termToDefine">UVA</i>&nbsp;
              and
              &nbsp;<i data-term="uvb" class="termToDefine">UVB</i> radiation. Sunglasses can protect both the eyes and the skin around the eyes.
