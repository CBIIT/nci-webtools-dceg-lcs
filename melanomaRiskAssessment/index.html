            An interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
            the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, San Francisco,
            to estimate a person's
            &nbsp;<a href="#about#results">absolute risk</a> of developing invasive melanoma. The tool helps clinicians identify
            individuals at increased risk of melanoma in order to plan
            appropriate screening interventions with them.

          <p><strong>Before using the tool, please note the following:</strong></p>
          <ul class="red-arrow">
            <li>
              The melanoma risk calculator was designed for use by health professionals during
              a routine physical examination that includes recording of information about the
              patient's personal and family medical history and an examination of the skin on
              the patient's back and shoulders. If you are not a health professional, you are
              strongly encouraged to discuss the results obtained with this tool and your personal
              risk of melanoma with your doctor.
            </li>
            <li>
              The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
              available.
            </li>
            <li>
              This tool should not be used to estimate melanoma risk for people who have already
              had a diagnosis of melanoma, melanoma-in-situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, or a family
              history of melanoma. These individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The melanoma risk calculator was developed using data from a large case-control
              study in the United States. Risks are estimated for non-Hispanic whites only; data
              for other races/ethnicities are too limited to accurately estimate risk.

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
              radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
              in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.

          <div class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 2: &nbsp;</strong><em>What is the patient's gender?</em></div>
          <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
            factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
            women.

          <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 3: &nbsp;</strong><em>What is the patient's race?</em></p>
          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
            were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
            often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
            damaged by the sun.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p class="about-question-title"><strong>Question 4: &nbsp;</strong><em>What is the patient's age?</em></p>
          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
            over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.

          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased risk
            of melanoma. Doctors advise protection from the sun to reduce the risk of melanoma.

          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong><br>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
            easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
            people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the
            sun.

          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
            not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
            to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
            however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
            that they have.

          <p class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
            larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
            and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier than
            on chronically exposed areas.

          <p>
            The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
            melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
            information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
            melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
            melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
            estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
            melanoma cancer.

          <p>
            The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
            patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
            Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
            in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
            model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
            been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
            additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            No one knows the exact causes of melanoma. Doctors can seldom explain why one person
            gets melanoma and another does not. However, research has shown that people with
            certain<a data-term="risk factors" class="termToDefine">risk factors</a>are more likely than others to develop melanoma. Anything that increases the chance
            of developing a disease is called a risk factor.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Personal history of melanoma or skin cancer:</strong> People who have been
            treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second, separate melanoma. Some people
            develop more than two melanomas. People who have had one or more of the common skin
            cancers (<a data-term="basal_cell_carcinoma" class="termToDefine"></a>basal
            cell carcinoma
             or<a data-term="squamous_cell_carcinoma" class="termToDefine"></a>squamous cell carcinoma
            ) are also at increased risk of melanoma. These
            individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs and this risk assessment
            tool is not appropriate for them.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Family history of melanoma:</strong> Melanoma sometimes runs in families.
            Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
            of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only
            about 1% of individuals with melanoma have more than one family member with
            melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
            with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Many ordinary moles:</strong> Having many moles, particularly larger moles,
            increases the risk of developing melanoma.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Dysplastic nevi:</strong> Dysplastic nevi are larger, flat, irregular moles
            that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
            relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
            of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
            risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi
            and melanoma.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Fair skin or freckles:</strong> Melanoma occurs more frequently in people
            who have fair skin that burns or freckles than in people with dark skin, probably
            because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
            had enough sun to damage their skin.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Severe, blistering sunburns:</strong> People who have had at least one severe,
            blistering sunburn are at increased risk of melanoma. Doctors particularly advise
            that parents protect children's skin from the sun. Such protection may reduce the
            risk of melanoma later in life.
          </p>
          <p><strong><a data-term="uv_rad" class="termToDefine">Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</a>:</strong> Melanoma is more common in people who
            live in areas that get large amounts of UV radiation from the sun. In the United
            States, for example, melanoma is more common in California than in Minnesota, where the
            sun is not as strong. UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin
            and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Artificial sources of UV radiation, such
            as sunlamps and tanning booths, can also cause skin damage and increase the risk
            of melanoma. Doctors encourage people to limit their exposure to natural UV radiation
            and to avoid artificial sources.:
          </p>
          <p><strong>Weakened &nbsp;<a data-term="immune_system" class="termToDefine">immune system:</a></strong>People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers or other
            immune disorders, or by drugs given after organ<a data-term="transplantation" class="termToDefine">transplantation</a>, are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Although these conditions
            are not common, it would be advisable for such individuals to be in
            screening and surveillance programs.
          </p>
          <p><strong>
              People who are concerned about developing melanoma should talk with their doctor
              about the disease, the symptoms to watch for, and an appropriate schedule for checkups.
              The doctor's advice will be based on the individual's personal and family history,
              medical history, and other risk factors.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Doctors recommend that everyone take steps to help prevent and reduce the risk of
            melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV radiation:
            <ul class="red-arrow">
              <li>
                Avoid exposure to the midday sun (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) whenever possible. When
                your shadow is shorter than you are, remember to protect yourself from the sun.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid exposure to artificial sources of UV radiation, such as sunlamps and tanning
                booths.
              </li>
              <li>If you must be outside, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a hat with a wide brim.</li>
              <li>
                Protect yourself from UV radiation that can penetrate light clothing, windshields,
                and windows.
              </li>
              <li>Protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice.</li>
              <li>Protect yourself when you are at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.</li>
              <li>Help protect your skin by using a lotion, cream, or gel that contains<a data-term="sunscreen" class="termToDefine"></a><em>sunscreen</em>. Use sunscreens
                    that reflect, absorb, and/or scatter both types of ultraviolet radiation. These
                    sunscreen products will be labeled with "broad-spectrum coverage." Use
                    a sunscreen with a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for more protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wear sunglasses that have UV-absorbing lenses. The label should specify that the
                lenses block at least 99 percent of<a data-term="uva" class="termToDefine">UVA</a> and<a data-term="uvb_rad" class="termToDefine">UVB</a> radiation. Sunglasses can protect both the eyes and the skin around the eyes.
