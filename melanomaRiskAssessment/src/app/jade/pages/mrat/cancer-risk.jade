            | No one knows the exact causes of melanoma. Doctors can seldom explain why one person
            | gets melanoma and another does not. However, research has shown that people with
            | certain
            | &nbsp;
            a.termToDefine(data-term="rf") risk factors
            |  are more likely than others to develop melanoma. Anything that increases the chance
            | of developing a disease is called a risk factor.

        dl
            dt Personal history of melanoma or skin cancer
            dd
                |  People who have been
                | treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second, separate melanoma. Some people
                | develop more than two melanomas. People who have had one or more of the common skin
                | cancers (
                a.termToDefine(data-term='bcc')
                | basal
                | cell carcinoma
                |  or
                a.termToDefine(data-term='scc')
                | squamous cell carcinoma
                | ) are also at increased risk of melanoma. These
                | individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs and this risk assessment
                | tool is not appropriate for them.
            dt Family history of melanoma:
            dd
                | Melanoma sometimes runs in families.
                | Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
                | of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only
                | about 1% of individuals with melanoma have more than one family member with
                | melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
                | with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.
            dt Many ordinary moles:
            dd
                | Having many moles, particularly larger moles,
                | increases the risk of developing melanoma.
            dt Dysplastic nevi:
            dd
                | Dysplastic nevi are larger, flat, irregular moles
                | that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
                | relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
                | of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
                | risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi
                | and melanoma.
            dt Fair skin or freckles:
            dd
                | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people
                | who have fair skin that burns or freckles than in people with dark skin, probably
                | because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
                | had enough sun to damage their skin.
            dt Severe, blistering sunburns:
            dd
                | People who have had at least one severe,
                | blistering sunburn are at increased risk of melanoma. Doctors particularly advise
                | that parents protect children's skin from the sun. Such protection may reduce the
                | risk of melanoma later in life.
            dt
                a.termToDefine(data-term='uv') Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                | :
            dd
                | Melanoma is more common in people who
                | live in areas that get large amounts of UV radiation from the sun. In the United
                | States, for example, melanoma is more common in California than in Minnesota, where the
                | sun is not as strong. UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin
                | and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Artificial sources of UV radiation, such
                | as sunlamps and tanning booths, can also cause skin damage and increase the risk
                | of melanoma. Doctors encourage people to limit their exposure to natural UV radiation
                | and to avoid artificial sources.

                | are not common, it would be advisable for such individuals to be in
                | screening and surveillance programs.

                | People who are concerned about developing melanoma should talk with their doctor
                | about the disease, the symptoms to watch for, and an appropriate schedule for checkups.
                | The doctor's advice will be based on the individual's personal and family history,
                | medical history, and other risk factors.

                li
                    | Avoid exposure to the midday sun (from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) whenever possible. When
                    | your shadow is shorter than you are, remember to protect yourself from the sun.

                    | If you must be outside, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a hat with a wide brim.
                li
                    | Protect yourself from UV radiation that can penetrate light clothing, windshields,
                    | and windows.
                li Protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice.
                li Protect yourself when you are at higher elevations, such as in the mountains.

                    |     that reflect, absorb, and/or scatter both types of ultraviolet radiation. These
                    |     sunscreen products will be labeled with "broad-spectrum coverage." Use
                    |     a sunscreen with a Solar Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for more protection.
