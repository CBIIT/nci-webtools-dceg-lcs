          | An interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
          | the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, San Francisco,
          | to estimate a person's
          | &nbsp;
          a(href='#about#results') absolute risk
          |  of developing invasive melanoma. The tool helps clinicians identify
          | individuals at increased risk of melanoma in order to plan
          | appropriate screening interventions with them.

            | The melanoma risk calculator was designed for use by health professionals during
            | a routine physical examination that includes recording of information about the
            | patient's personal and family medical history and an examination of the skin on
            | the patient's back and shoulders. If you are not a health professional, you are
            | strongly encouraged to discuss the results obtained with this tool and your personal
            | risk of melanoma with your doctor.
          li
            | The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
            | available.
          li
            | This tool should not be used to estimate melanoma risk for people who have already
            | had a diagnosis of melanoma, melanoma-in-situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, or a family
            | history of melanoma. These individuals should be in screening and surveillance programs.
          li
            | The melanoma risk calculator was developed using data from a large case-control
            | study in the United States. Risks are estimated for non-Hispanic whites only; data
            | for other races/ethnicities are too limited to accurately estimate risk.
