                em Does the patient live in the Northern, Central, or Southern United States?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                | Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
                | radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
                | in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.

        .about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
            | factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
            | women.

        p.about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
            | were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
            | often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
            | damaged by the sun.

        p.about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
            | over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.

            | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
            | easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
            | people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the
            | sun.

                | After repeated and prolonged exposure to sunlight, at the age the patient is now,
                | how tan would the patient's skin become?
        p.about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
            | not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
            | to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
            | however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
            | that they have.

        p.about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
            | larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
            | and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier than
            | on chronically exposed areas.

            | Having many moles, particularly larger moles, increases the risk of developing melanoma.
            | The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
            | than on chronically exposed areas. Characteristics of the back are highly correlated
            | with total body characteristics.

        p.about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            | UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that
            | can lead to melanoma.

        p
            | The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
            | melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
            | information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
            | melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
            | melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
            | estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
            | melanoma cancer.

            | available.

        strong About the Model
        p
            | The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
            | patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
            | Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
            | in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
            | model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
            | been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
            | additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.
        p
            | The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
            | available. The system is currently on statistical model version 1 and software version
