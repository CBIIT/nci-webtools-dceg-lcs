            | If you have close relatives (parents, brothers, sisters,
            |  or children) who have had colorectal cancer, your risk
            |  of colorectcal cancer is slightly higher. This is more
            |  true if the relative had the cancer at a young age. If
            |  you have many close relatives who have had colorectal
            |  cancer, the risk can be even higher.
