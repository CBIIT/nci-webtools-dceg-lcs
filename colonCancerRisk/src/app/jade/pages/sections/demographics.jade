            p When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white
                |  people and found it to be accurate in estimating their risk of
                | colorectal cancer. If you are Hispanic/Latino, this tool
                | can still estimate your risk. But, because there
                | is not as much data available for these groups,
                | your results may be less accurate.
            p In the future, we hope to make this tool more
                | accurate for Hispanics/Latinos, as researchers
                | complete studies that will provide information
                | to update the tool for these groups.
            p Although the tool is not perfect, the information
                | you learn from using it can still help you
                | and your doctor better understand your risk of colorectal cancer.
