            |  Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to calculate the risk of invasive breast cancer
            |  is not accurate for women with a history of DCIS or LCIS. In addition, the tool

            |  medical history of breast cancer.

            strong Explanation
            br
            |  Although the tool has been used with success in clinics for women with strong family
            |  histories of breast cancer, more specific methods of estimating risk are appropriate

            |  such as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, that increase a womanâ€™s risk for breast cancer. This
            |  tool will not appropriately estimate breast cancer risk for such women. There may

        .about-question-title Question 3: What is the woman's age?
        .about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            br
            | The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The great majority of breast
            |  cancer cases occur in women older than age 50. Most cancers develop slowly over
            |  time. For this reason, breast cancer is more common among older women.

            br
            |  Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 have a slightly increased
            |  risk of breast cancer. The levels of the female hormone estrogen change with the
            |  menstrual cycle. Women who start menstruating at a very young age have a slight
            |  increase in breast cancer risk that may be linked to their longer lifetime exposure
            |  to estrogen.

            |  Women who have had breast biopsies have an increased risk of breast cancer, especially
            |  if their biopsy specimens showed atypical hyperplasia. Women who have a history
            |  of breast biopsies are at increased risk because of whatever breast changes prompted
            |  the biopsies. Breast biopsies themselves do not cause cancer.
        .about-question-title Question 8: If known, please indicate the woman's race/ethnicity.
        .about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            p
                |  The original Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was based on data from white women.
                |  But race/ethnicity can influence the calculation of breast cancer risk. Over the
                |  years, as additional data became available, researchers at the NCI updated the tool
                |  to more accurately estimate risk for African American, and Asian and Pacific Islander
                |  women. (see references 5 and 6). For Hispanic women, part of the model is derived
                |  from white women who participated in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project
                |  and from SEER data. The risk estimates for Hispanic women are therefore subject
                |  to greater uncertainty than those for white women. Calculations for American Indian
                |  and Alaskan Native women are based entirely on data for white women and may not
                |  be accurate. Recent immigrants from rural China and certain other parts of Asia
                |  probably have lower risk than predicted by the model. Researchers are conducting
                |  additional studies, including studies with minority populations, to gather more
                |  data and to increase the accuracy of the tool.

                  | If the woman's race/ethnicity is unknown, the tool will use

        .about-question-title Question 8a: What is the sub race/ethnicity?
        .about-question-explanation
            strong Explanation
            p
                | To calculate breast cancer risk using Asian-American as the race/ethnicity, the
                |  sub race/ethnicity needs to be known. If the sub-category of race/ethnicity is not
                |  known, then "Unknown" should be selected in Question 8, rather than Asian-American.
                |  The "Other Asian American" category includes women of Asian Indian/Pakistani, Korean,
                |  Vietnamese, Laotian, and Kampuchean descent. The "Other Pacific Islander" category
                |  includes women of Guamanian, Samoan, and Tongan descent.

    #results-exp.content-details.rounded
        p
            | The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool will estimate a woman's risk of developing
            | invasive breast cancer during the next 5-year period and up to age 90 (lifetime
            | risk) based on the woman's age and the risk factor information provided. For comparison,
            | the tool will then calculate 5-year and lifetime risk estimates for a woman of the
            | same age who is at average risk for developing breast cancer. Lifetime risk estimates
            | are higher than 5-year age interval estimates because breast cancer risk increases
            | with years at risk.
        p
            | Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute breast cancer risk.
            | Absolute breast cancer risk is the chance or probability of developing invasive
            | breast cancer in a defined age interval. One way to evaluate the accuracy of the
            | risk estimate is to determine whether it correctly predicts average risk in a group
            | of women with the same risk factors and age. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
            | does predict such average risks well.
        p
            | Although a woman's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow
            | one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women
            | who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who
            | do develop breast cancer.
        p
            | The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool may be updated periodically as new data or
            | research becomes available.
    h3 About the Gail Model
    #model-exp.content-details.rounded
        | The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model known as
        | the "Gail model," which is named after
        a(target="_blank", href='http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/gail-mitchell')
            | Dr. Mitchell Gail
        | , Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of NCI's
        |  Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. The model uses a woman's own personal
        |  medical history, her own reproductive history, and the history of breast cancer
        |  among her first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) to estimate her risk
        |  of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time. Data from the
        |  Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), which was a joint NCI and
        |  American Cancer Society breast cancer screening study that involved 280,000 women
        |  aged 35 to 74 years, and from NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
        |  (SEER) Program were used in developing the model. Estimates for African American
        |  women were based on data from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences
        |  (CARE) Study and from SEER data. CARE participants included 1,607 women with invasive
        |  breast cancer and 1,637 without. Estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander women
        |  in the United States were based on data from the Asian American Breast Cancer Study
        |  (AABCS) and SEER data. AABCS participants included 597 Asian and Pacific Islander
        |  women with invasive breast cancer, and 966 women without breast cancer.
      p
        | The Gail model has been tested in large populations of white women and has been
        | shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk. In other words, the model
        | has been "validated" for white women. It has also been tested in data from the Womenâ€™s
        | Health Initiative for African American women, and the model performs well, but may
        | underestimate risk in African American women with previous biopsies.The model has
        | been validated for Asian and Pacific Islander women in the WHI and data from SEER.
        | The model needs further validation for Hispanic women and other subgroups. Researchers
        | are conducting additional studies, including studies with minority populations,
        | to gather more data and to test and improve the model.
