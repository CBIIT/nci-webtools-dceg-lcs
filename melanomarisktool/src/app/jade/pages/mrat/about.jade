        .exp-title Explaining the Questions
        #questions-exp
            .about-question-title Question 1: In what state does the patient reside?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Melanoma is more common in people who live in areas that get large amounts of UV
                    | radiation from the sun. For example, melanoma is more common in California than
                    | in Minnesota, where the sun is not as strong.
            .about-question-title Question 2: What is the patient's gender?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | In the United States, melanoma incidence is higher for men than for women. Risk
                    | factors for melanoma and sun behavior patterns are also different between men and
                    | women.
            .about-question-title Question 3: What is the patient's race?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | The risks are estimated only for non-Hispanic whites; data on other ethnicities
                    | were too limited to accurately estimate risk. White people get melanoma far more
                    | often than do African American people, probably because light skin is more easily
                    | damaged by the sun.
            .about-question-title Question 4: What is the patient's age?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Most cancers develop slowly
                    | over time. For this reason, melanoma is more common among older individuals.
            .about-question-title Question 5: Has the patient ever had a blistering sunburn?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn are at increased risk
                    | of melanoma. Doctors advise protection from the sun to reduce the risk of melanoma.
            .about-question-title
                | Question 5 for females:
                br
                | Question 6 for males: Is the patient's complexion light, medium, or dark?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles
                    | easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in
                    | people with dark skin, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the
                    | sun.
            .about-question-title
                | Question 6 (for females only): After repeated and prolonged exposure to sunlight, at the age the patient is now,
                | how tan would the patient's skin become?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and does
                    | not tan well. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
                    | to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
                    | however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
                    | that they have.
            .about-question-title
                | Question 7 (for males only): How many moles larger than 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
                    | larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
                    | and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier than
                    | on chronically exposed areas.
            .about-question-title
                | Question 7 for females:
                br
                | Question 8 for males: How many moles less than or equal to 5mm in diameter are on the patient's back?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Having many moles, particularly larger moles, increases the risk of developing melanoma.
                    | The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
                    | than on chronically exposed areas. Characteristics of the back are highly correlated
                    | with total body characteristics.
            .about-question-title
                | Question 8 for females:
                br
                | Question 9 for males: How extensive is the freckling on the patient's back and shoulders?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that freckles easily.
                    | The back and shoulders are commonly and readily examined and the evaluation is easier
                    | than on chronically exposed areas.

            .about-question-title
                | Question 10 (for males only): Does the patient have severe solar damage on the shoulders?
            .about-question-explanation
                strong Explanation
                p
                    | UV radiation from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that
                    | can lead to melanoma.
        .exp-title Explaining the Results
        #results-exp
            p
                | The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool will estimate an individual's risk of developing
                | melanoma during the next 5-year period and up to age 70 based on the risk factor
                | information provided. Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute
                | melanoma risk. Absolute melanoma risk is the chance or probability of developing
                | melanoma in a defined age interval. Although an individual's risk may be accurately
                | estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely who will develop
                | melanoma cancer.
            p
                | The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
                | available.
        .exp-title About the Model
        #model-exp
            p
                | The Melanoma Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model. The model uses
                | patient's self-reported history and a brief physical exam by a health care professional.
                | Data from a case-control study involved 1663 non-Hispanic white patients from clinics
                | in Philadelphia, PA and San Francisco, CA were used in developing the model. This
                | model has not been tested in large populations. In other words, the model has not
                | been "validated" for all non-Hispanic whites. Researchers are conducting
                | additional studies and welcome partnerships to validate this tool.
            p
                | The MRAT risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes
                | available. The system is currently on statistical model version 1 and software version
