							p The melanoma risk calculator was designed for use by health professionals to estimate a patient’s absolute risk of developing invasive melanoma. 
								| Absolute risk is the likelihood that a person will develop a specific type of cancer over a certain period of time, in this case 5 years.

							p Although an individual’s risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions cannot precisely determine who will develop melanoma. 
								| If you are not a health professional, you are strongly encouraged to discuss your results and personal risk of melanoma with your doctor.

							| The melanoma risk calculator was developed using data from a large case-control study in the United States. 
							| Risks are estimated for non-Hispanic whites only between 20 and 70 years of age. Data for other
							| races/ethnicities are too limited to accurately estimate risk.
