# used the angular-livescript-seed github project as a template
# will most likely take a few unused features out, i.e. angular

* LiveScript
* gulp
* bower
* stylus

* js (and later include ls -> js files)are concatenated into scripts.js
* partial templates written in jade are turned into html and included in index html file
* css files are concatenated into styles.css

# Usage

## --- DO THIS FIRST--
Install required packages:
1.    install node.js, if not already installed
2.    run following commands in command line in the directory which the code will be
3.    `$ npm install` -- to download node packages required for this project (Only need to run when first pulling down code or when new node_packages are added in package.json)
4.    `$ npm run build` -- to compile code which is placed in the xampp folder

* Once compiled the code will be generated one folder level above the gulpfile.js in the project root directory
