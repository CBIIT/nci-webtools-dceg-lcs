                Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have skin that burns easily and is
                damaged by the sun. Sun resistance, or the ability to tan instead of burn when exposed
                to the sun, has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma. People who tan well,
                however, are also at risk of melanoma and their risk is higher the more sun exposure
                that they have.
