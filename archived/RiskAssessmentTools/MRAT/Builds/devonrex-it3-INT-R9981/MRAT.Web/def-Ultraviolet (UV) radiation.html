            <strong>Ultraviolet Radiation</strong> (ul-tra-VYE-o-let ray-dee-AY-shun)
        </p>
        <p>
            UV radiation. Invisible
            rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. UV radiation also comes
            from sun lamps and tanning beds. UV radiation can damage the skin and cause melanoma
            and other types of skin cancer. UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface is
            made up of two types of rays, called UVA and UVB rays. UVB rays are more likely
            than UVA rays to cause sunburn, but UVA rays pass deeper into the skin. Scientists
            have long thought that UVB radiation can cause melanoma and other types of skin
            cancer. They now think that UVA radiation also may add to skin damage that can lead
            to skin cancer and cause premature aging. For this reason, skin specialists recommend
            that people use sunscreens that reflect, absorb, or scatter both kinds of UV radiation.
