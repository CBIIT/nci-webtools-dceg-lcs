                                                            Having close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. About 10 percent
                                                            of all patients with melanoma have another family member with this disease; only

                                                            melanoma. When melanoma runs in a family, all close family members of individuals
                                                            with melanoma should be checked regularly by a doctor.</p>

                                                            increases the risk of developing melanoma.</p>

                                                            that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are
                                                            relatively common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. The risk
                                                            of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. The
                                                            risk is especially high for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi

                                                            because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun. People who have freckles have
                                                            had enough sun to damage their skin.</p>
