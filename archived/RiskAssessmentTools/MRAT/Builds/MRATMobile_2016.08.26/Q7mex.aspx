                Having many moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are
                larger moles that are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. The back
                and shoulders are commonly and readily examined, and evaluation of these sites is
                easier than on chronically exposed areas. Characteristics of the back are highly
                correlated with total body characteristics.
