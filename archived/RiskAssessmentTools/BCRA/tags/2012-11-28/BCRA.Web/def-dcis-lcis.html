<strong>DCIS</strong><br />
DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a milk duct of the breast.  These abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct. There are several types of DCIS.  If not removed, some types may change over time and become invasive cancers.  Most do not become invasive cancers.

<strong>LCIS</strong><br />
LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) is a condition in which abnormal cells found in the lining of the breast's milk-producing glands called lobules. LCIS has not spread outside the lobules.  Although LCIS is not considered to be actual breast cancer at this noninvasive stage, it is a warning sign of increased risk of developing invasive cancer.
