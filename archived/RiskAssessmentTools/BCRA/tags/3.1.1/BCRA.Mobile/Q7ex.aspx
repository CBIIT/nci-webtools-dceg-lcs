                While race/ethnicity is included in the calculation, it does not influence breast cancer risk as much as other factors. The model for African American women was derived from the Women’s Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study (see reference 5) and NCI’s SEER Program.The model for Asian and Pacific Islander women in the United States was derived from the Asian American Breast Cancer Study (AABCS) and NCI’s SEER Program (see reference 6). For other Hispanic women, part of the model is derived from white women who participated in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project and from SEER data. The risk estimates for Hispanic women are therefore subject to greater uncertainty than those for white women. Calculations for American Indian and Alaskan Native women are based entirely on data for white women and may not be accurate. Researchers are conducting additional studies, including studies with minority populations, to gather more data and to increase the accuracy of the tool for women in these populations.

                <b>Note:</b> If the woman's race/ethnicity is unknown, the tool will use data for white females to estimate the predicted risk.
