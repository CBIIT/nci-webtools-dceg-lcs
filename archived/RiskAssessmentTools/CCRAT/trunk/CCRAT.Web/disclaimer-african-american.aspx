    <p>When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white people and found it to be accurate in estimating their risk of colorectal cancer.  If you are African American, this tool can still estimate your risk. But, because there is not as much data available for this group, your results may be less accurate.</p>
    <p>In the future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for African Americans, as researchers complete studies that will provide information to update the tool for this group.</p>
    <p>Although the tool is not perfect, the information you learn from using it can still help you and your doctor better understand your risk of colorectal cancer.</p>
