        When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white people and found it to
        be accurate in estimating their risk of colorectal cancer. If you are African American,
        Asian American/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino, this tool can still estimate your
        risk. But, because there is not as much data available for these groups, your results
        may be less accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics/Latinos, as researchers complete studies that will
        provide information to update the tool for these groups.

        Although the tool is not perfect, the information you learn from using it can still help you and your doctor better understand
        your risk of colorectal cancer.
