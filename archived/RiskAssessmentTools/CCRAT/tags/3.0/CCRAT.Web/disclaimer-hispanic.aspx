    <p>When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white people and found it to be accurate in estimating their risk of colorectal cancer. If you are Hispanic/Latino, this tool can still estimate your risk. But, because there is not as much data available for this group, your results may be less accurate.</p>
    <p>In the future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for Hispanics/Latinos, as researchers complete studies that will provide information to update the tool for this group.</p>
    <p>Although the tool is not perfect, the information you learn from using it can still help you and your doctor better understand your risk of colorectal cancer.</p>
