        More than 90 percent of people with colorectal cancer are diagnosed after age 50.
        The average age at diagnosis is 72. The tool currently provides reliable estimates
        of colorectal cancer risk for individuals over age 50. As more data become available,
        we hope to extend it to younger ages.
