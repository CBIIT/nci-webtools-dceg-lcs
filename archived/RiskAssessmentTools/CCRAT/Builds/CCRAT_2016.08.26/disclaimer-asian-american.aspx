    <p>When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white people and found it to be accurate in estimating their risk of colorectal cancer.  If you are Asian American or Pacific Islander, this tool can still estimate your risk. But, because there is not as much data available for these groups, your results may be less accurate.</p>
    <p>In the future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as researchers complete studies that will provide information to update the tool for these groups.</p>
    <p>Although the tool is not perfect, the information you learn from using it can still help you and your doctor better understand your risk of colorectal cancer.</p>
