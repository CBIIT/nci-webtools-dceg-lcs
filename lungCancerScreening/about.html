                <h4>Lung Cancer Screening Tool</h4>
                <p>The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) compared the efficacy of low-dose helical CT with that of standard chest X-ray for detecting lung cancer.  Low-dose CT resulted in 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality, and the <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Topic/recommendation-summary/lung-cancer-screening" target="_blank" title="USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force)">US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)</a> recommends CT lung screening for those 50-80 years of age, minimum 30 pack-years of smoking, and no more than 15 years since quitting.  The Risk-based NLST Outcomes Tool (RNOT) provides chance of diagnosis and death from lung cancer, and risk of false-positive CT screen, based on data from the NLST.</p>
